### Quick Start (Windows, macOS, Linux)

You need to run the command
bash run.sh

This downloads the necessary files,( though each system is different hence it very difficualt to generalize the libraries across the board).

The model should run with taking about a minute or two to produce the results, please be patient as it depends on each machine.
If the model is not using any GPU the results will be very poor and take a lot of time.
